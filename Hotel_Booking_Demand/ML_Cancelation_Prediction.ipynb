    "# Hotel booking\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains data from two different hotels. One Resort hotel and one City hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the publication (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) we know that both hotels are located in Portugal (southern Europe) (\"H1 at the resort region of Algarve and H2 at the city of Lisbon\"). The distance between these two locations is ca. 280 km by car and both locations border on the north atlantic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains \"bookings due to arrive between the 1st of July of 2015 and the 31st of August 2017\".  \n",

    "Columns description:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `is_canceled` - Value indicating if the booking was canceled (1) or not (0)\n",
    "   - `lead_time` - Number of days that elapsed between the entering date of the booking into the PMS and the arrival date\n",
    "   - `arrival_date_year` - Year of arrival date\n",
    "   - `arrival_date_month` - Month of arrival date\n",

    "   - `previous_cancellations` - Number of previous bookings that were cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking\n",
    "   - `previous_bookings_not_canceled` - Number of previous bookings not cancelled by the customer prior to the current booking\n",
    "   - `reserved_room_type` - Code of room type reserved. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.\n",
    "   - `assigned_room_type` - Code for the type of room assigned to the booking. Sometimes the assigned room type differs from the reserved room type due to hotel operation reasons (e.g. overbooking) or by customer request. Code is presented instead of designation for anonymity reasons.\n",
    "   - `booking_changes` - Number of changes/amendments made to the booking from the moment the booking was entered on the PMS until the moment of check-in or cancellation\n",
    "   - `deposit_type` - Indication on if the customer made a deposit to guarantee the booking. This variable can assume three categories: No Deposit – no deposit was made; Non Refund – a deposit was made in the value of the total stay cost; Refundable – a deposit was made with a value under the total cost of stay.\n",
    "   - `agentID` - of the travel agency that made the booking\n",

    "   - `total_of_special_requests` - Number of special requests made by the customer (e.g. twin bed or high floor)  \n",
    "   - `reservation_status` - Reservation last status, assuming one of three categories: Canceled – booking was canceled by the customer; Check-Out – customer has checked in but already departed; No-Show – customer did not check-in and did inform the hotel of the reason why\n",
    "   - `reservation_status_date` - Date at which the last status was set. This variable can be used in conjunction with the ReservationStatus to understand when was the booking canceled or when did the customer checked-out of the hotel"
